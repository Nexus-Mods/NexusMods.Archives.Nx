///     This is a step of the .NX packing process that involves grouping the
///     files by extension.
///
///     Grouping the files by extension, (equivalent to 7zip `qs` parameter)
///     improves compression ratio, as data between different files of same
///     type is likely to be similar.
///
///     For example, you have two text files, two images, and two audio files.
///     Provided their extension matches, they should be grouped together.
///
///     The Nx packing pipeline typically starts with the following steps:
///     - Sort Files Ascending by Size
///     - Group File by Extension (üëà This Class ‚ÄºÔ∏è)
